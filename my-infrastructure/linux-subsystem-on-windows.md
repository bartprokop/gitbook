It is pretty cool to use bash on Windows. Seems to works a bit better than Cygwin or GitBash. The very first thing I do after installing Ubuntu from Windows Store is creating symlink to my user directory. This makes life much easier.

```
$ ln -s /mnt/c/Users/myusername winhome
```

Also the system need to be keep up to date. The standard Linux commands helps here

```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get upgrade
```

Installing Ansible is what I need to manage my Cloud servers.

```
$ sudo apt-get install ansible
```
