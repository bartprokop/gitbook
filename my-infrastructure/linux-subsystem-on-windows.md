It is pretty cool to use bash on Windows. Seems to works a bit better than Cygwin or GitBash. The very first thing I do after installing Ubuntu from Windows Store is creating symlink to my user directory. This makes life much easier.

> bart@DESKTOP-12BHSJAH:~$ ln -s /mnt/c/Users/myusername winhome
