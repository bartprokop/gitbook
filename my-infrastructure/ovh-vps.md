I use OVH VPS for my leisure computing. Those are cheap, solid and comes with Arch Linux - the one that I prefer to use over any other distribution \(sorry Debian - you're my second choice\).

Keeping your system up-to-date is one of most important tasks. Here is how to do this:

> \[root@vps123456 ~\]\# pacman -Syu  
> \[root@vps123456 ~\]\# sync  
> \[root@vps123456 ~\]\# reboot
